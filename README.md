This is a personal repo that contains random coding-challenges for Visualizations, Simulations, Games, .. random stuff I come by that looks interesting.

This repo will grow through time, still looking for some challenges I can work with.

All challenges are written in TypeScript without any fancy frameworks. Just plain old `vanilla` code.

If I used a library, it's mostly just for easier access. Like, for the Boid simulation, I used a `Vector-library` that extended the basic JavaScript/TypeScript objects with a useful Vector object-type. This made my life a whole lot easier than to write everything myself for example.

Anyway, all demo's will be available [here](https://bertmaurau.be/projects/visualizations-and-simulations/)
